Additionally, they need to be logged in either with Google or a custom sign-in for them to create posts",

It first makes a request to the url, transforms the response to raw HTML using BeautifulSoup, and then takes the relevant data and adds it to a Google Sheet. I created this project because searching for jobs is a lot of busy work and automating the search would free up time.",
